    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">For each submission, you
    should update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have
    for improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs
    in the project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the
    project that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new
    features for the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or
    issues for a particular project, add an entry that says "no
    suggestions" or something similar.<br>
    <br>
    Project 1<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: Currently, there is nothing found to improve this
        project. </li>
      <li>Howard Lee: The details about controllers and networks were
        went over during project2. I think the explanations for the
        modules could had been gone over before project2.</li>
      <li>Hua Liu: no suggestions.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 2<br>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        Zhu Zhang: File headings in image files should not list all
        group members, it is better to just list the author's name and
        AndrewID.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Hua Liu: no suggestions.</li>
      <li>Howard Lee: Nothing in particular. The documents for each
        modules were fairly well explained. </li>
    </ul>
    Project 3<br>
    <ul>
      <li> Zhu Zhang: It is confusing that whether sequence diagram
        should or should not include boxes about state variables
        changes.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Hua Liu: It is really not a good idea to use xls to manage the
        traceability form, for Git tracks xls files as binary objects,
        and simply overwrites old version when it tries to merge
        conflicted commits.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Hua Liu: Moreover, I personally highly recommend using
        Markdown to edit all documents and generate HTML files. </li>
      <li>Howard Lee : Adding to what Zhu said, it is unclear whether we
        should map requirements like set dwell and countdown to the
        sequence diagram.&nbsp; Those requirements are implied, but do
        not explicitly appear on the sequence diagram.<br>
      </li>

        think this is a bug. </li>
      <li>Hua Liu: (No comment)<br>
      </li>
      <li>Howard Lee: As I was doing state chart for DoorController, I
        was confused how I should add a case for DoorReversal if I am
        not allowed to modify TT Req.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 5<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Zhu Zhang: There is no DriveSpeed Sensor in the code, but it
        appeals in the architecture diagram.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Hua Liu: The code should come with more document about how to
        write/read messages.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Howard Lee: For DoorControl, the maxcarweight could not be
        modified, therefore not included as part of the trace.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 6<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Howard Lee: More documents related to sensors and actuators
        would be helpful.&nbsp; </li>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: I don't think all inputs of each controllers are
        used, only some of them are useful, why not keep them simpler?</li>
      <li>Hua Liu: Documents should be more clear about which
        messages/inputs/outputs should be considered before midterm
        (Sabbath mode) and which should not.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 7<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Howard Lee: Scenarios that were created initially were more
        than what we needed for the first demo.&nbsp; However the demo
        requires that we have everything from scenarios.&nbsp; There
        should be more clear instructions on whether some scenarios
        could be left out or everything must be included.</li>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: Nothing found.</li>
      <li>Hua Liu: (No comment)<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 8<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Howard Lee: Project 8 seems concise and accurate in delivering
        goals of this project.</li>
      <li>Hua Liu: (No comment)</li>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: No suggestion</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 9<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: I think this project can also include Drive
        Statechart, Drive Code Implementation and corresponding unit
        test.</li>
      <li>Howard Lee: No suggestion</li>
      <li>Hua Liu : No Comment<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 10<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Howard Lee: Revision on door control, dispatcher and drive
        control was implemented in a planned and organized process.</li>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: No suggestion.</li>
      <li>Hua Liu: No suggestion<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 11<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: Some messages like mCarLantern,
        mCarPositionIndicator are not mentioned in requirement1.html but
        appear in requirement2.html. Actually, these messages are not
        used in the implementation, so I suggest removing them
        completely.</li>
      <li>Howard Lee: Fast mode requirement, RT-9 could be better
        defined or advice could had been given in advance about its
        wording.</li>
      <li>Hua Liu: No Suggestion<br>

    <ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 12<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Howard Lee: The random seeds could had been given in prior
        projects so we have more time to prepare.</li>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: No suggestions</li>
      <li>Hua Liu: No Suggestion.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 13<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: I believe there should be more details about fault
        tolerance implementation.</li>
      <li>Hua Liu: Same as Zhu. Fault tolerance requirements don't make
        any sense.</li>
      <li>Howard Lee: No suggestions.<br>

    <ul>
      <li>Zhu Zhang: Overall this project is fantastic excellent and it
        is extremely useful, especially it is a very good one to talk
        about when being asked to describe a project you have done in
        school during an interview. I feel like I have learned a lot
        about real world software engineering stuff. However, the
        biggest problem of this project is about those useless unit
        tests and integration tests. They can barely find any bugs.
        Besides, they cost us a lot of time to fix the tests themselves
        instead of our implementation and each time we change our
        implementation we have to fix those tests over and over again
        even when the implementation can pass all acceptance tests.</li>
      <li>Hua Liu: The precious part of this project is the design
        process that we followed, the documents we wrote, and the test
        we ran. But I think to make these excellent process really work,
        instead of only given "what to do (e.g., you should write this
        document, you should test this)", it would be much better to
        explain "why and how we should do them".</li>
      <li>Howard Lee: The design process was very helpful for us to see
        what really matters in making a great product.&nbsp; All the
        extensive reviews and documents that we had to write was a good
        preparation for us to get into the real design process in a
        company.&nbsp; The industry related things that we covered was
        generally very helpful.&nbsp; Much of the projects that we had
        to do every week was well made but it would had been better if
        it was explained in more detail why and how to do such and
        such.&nbsp; Much of the projects was mainly done by
        self-learning and lots of time was spent mainly on figuring out
        what the project is about.&nbsp; There could had been more
        explanations what each project means and how all the projects
        tie together.<br>
